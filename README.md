# AlertCam Real Time Face Recognition and Alert System
The project – AlertCam, is a smart home security system that aims to automate door access of domestic places using facial recognition technology capable of increasing the level of safety in homes. This system recognizes the individuals approaching your door with a camera and compares them with the database of authorized faces, build using ESP32-CAM module. In a scenario where the person is identified, the door automatically unlocks for them when they arrive. That way, the door stays locked if the face is not recognized.

The goal of this project is to provide an inexpensive and simple security system that can augment the traditional locks and keys. Homeowners are usually not at home to check every visitor one–by–one so this is where AlertCam comes in with its face recognition technology and automated control. In short, the ESP32-CAM executes facial recognition on the hardware itself making it low-cost and simple without the need for any device or complex setup.

The AlertCam includes a live video feed feature that streams real-time footage to the homeowner's mobile device whenever someone approaches the door. This allows the homeowner to monitor the situation remotely, providing instant access to live visuals. With this functionality, homeowners can make informed decisions, such as identifying visitors and taking appropriate action, even when they are not at home, ensuring enhanced security and peace of mind [1].
